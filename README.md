# pyipn

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grburgess/pyipn/master/logo.png)

PyIPN is a tool for simulating GRB light curves observed by gamma-ray detectors dispersed throughout the Universe. Additionally, it provides fitting routines for fitting these light curves via random Fourier features to tringulate the location of the simulated GRB. 

This work is a build upon the classical [InterPlanetary Network (IPN)](http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/) developed to do source tringulation via cross-corelation of the observed light curves.
