# pyipn

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grburgess/pyipn/master/logo.png)

PyIPN is a tool for simulating GRB light curves observed by gamma-ray detectors dispersed throughout the Universe (theorectically, but mostly in the Sol system). 

The sister fitting code that recovers the time-delays and localizations of the simulated GRBs is [Nazgul](https://github.com/grburgess/nazgul). 

This work is built upon the classical [InterPlanetary Network (IPN)](http://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3/) developed to do source tringulation via cross-corelation of the observed light curves.
